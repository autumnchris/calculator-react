# Calculator (React)

My project for the [Build a JavaScript Calculator challenge](https://learn.freecodecamp.org/front-end-libraries/front-end-libraries-projects/build-a-javascript-calculator) as part of the curriculum for the Front End Libraries Certification on [Free Code Camp](https://www.freecodecamp.org). Built with React.
